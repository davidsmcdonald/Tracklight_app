# Tracklight_app
Tracklight android app

Tracklight is a Android/Web application for public location sharing. I wanted to
try out my general programming knowledge in an unfamiliar format (Android, in
this case) with an unfamiliar language (kotlin) and get them working with a
simple web application.

The project has lots of potential for future development and would certainly
require security and scaling concerns to be addressed along with any feature
additions. Nonetheless, it was a fun challenge and exciting to get up and
running!

The app itself can be downloaded at the google play store (as internal testing) here: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.dsmllt.lltracker

This repository holds the android application and server functionality, while the web 
application is separately located here: https://github.com/davidsmcdonald/Tracklight
